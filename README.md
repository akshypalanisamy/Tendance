# Tendance

  Massive events require an intelligent approach to authenticate those in attendance. Our application is a location-based verification system for social events of less than one thousand people. The system will authenticate the location of an attendee at a specified event time. When the attendee becomes within the radius of a specified location, their attendance for the event will be verified. In addition to event attendance statistics, event organizers will then have the ability to see present attendees and send notifications to all present attendees in case of an event update or emergency. Tendance will help managers keep track of attendance for single or recurring events. 

This system will allow event managers to gain insight into when attendees arrive and depart the venue. Tendance targets users who are facilitators of activity, both professional and academic. Tendance could provide aid to educators with the commission of recording daily attendance, to organizational managers with the confirmation of an hourly schedule, or to hosts of conferences with the objective of determining most popular topics. With this data event coordinators can notify present attendees in case of emergency. The system will collect location data from attendees to improve pattern recognition visibility for attendance. An Android application is being built to automatically take the attendance of a social gathering. Target users are professors needing an efficient way to take attendance, managers wishing to view present employees, or event coordinators wishing to maximize customer experience.

The application was written in Java using Android Studio to run on any Android Device running Android 8.0 and above. The Google Maps API was used for searching and retrieving the event and user's location. The backend is written in Python utilizing the flask framework and the data is stored in a MySQL database. The application server and the database are hosted on an Ubuntu server.
