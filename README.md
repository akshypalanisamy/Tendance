# Tendance

  Massive events require an intelligent approach to authenticate those in attendance. Our application is a location-based verification system for social events of less than one thousand people. The system will authenticate the location of an attendee at a specified event time. When the attendee becomes within the radius of a specified location, their attendance for the event will be verified. In addition to event attendance statistics, event organizers will then have the ability to see present attendees and send notifications to all present attendees in case of an event update or emergency. Tendance will help managers keep track of attendance for single or recurring events.
